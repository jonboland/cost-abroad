# cost-abroad

A tool for visualising information about the relative day-to-day costs of visiting different countries in Europe.

There are wide variations in the cost of food, accommodation, transport etc. between European countries, so being able to get a simple overview of this in choropleth format can help with planning trips and budgeting when travelling on holiday or business.

Data is drawn from eurostat's price level indices, which are based on a country's purchasing power parity divided by its current nominal exchange rate.
